This week I expect you to achieve the understanding of the suggested task. I.e. to do the following:
1. Download the dataset. Make sure that you are able to visualize MRI scans and read .plq files with lesion coordinates and cropped views. The example is in the attached notebook.
2. Describe the attached picture. What is the region highlighted on MRI scan, and how is this scan connected to the MS disease?
3. What is the target variable in the dataset? What is the meaning of this score? 
4. Propose the hypothesis about the lesion features that, in your opinion, can be connected with the further progress of MS disease. For example:  
"I expect to see different EDSS score depending on the total volume of lesions. Because an increasal of the number of demyelinated axons leads to an increased signal transmission impairment"

The dataset is lack of file with EDSS data. I'll try to get this part as fast as possible. Please work on other questions that do not require the usage of this file.

The information about some of lesion features is situated on a page 5 of the suggested paper and in the table on the page 7. The analysis of the features proposed by authors can be found on pages 6, 9. Please use these suggestions to put your own hypothesis. Also, please do not forget to mention all sources you've used.
