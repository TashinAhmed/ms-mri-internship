The goal of MS subproject is to find out is the given dataset applicable to solve the problem proposed by authors. As a reminder, the original problem can be  simply formulated as "to estimate disease progress using lesion features". 

The task for this week is to check the significance (or insignificance) of interconnection between the given feature and the EDSS score. Or, as proposed by research authors, the derived feature, EDSS > 2. 

Please look at the description.ipynb file. There is a bunch of hypotheses suggested during the first iteration. Let's split our work in the following manner:

- Abhishek - shape features, A-D
- Ahmed - shape features, E-G 
- Subhaditya - texture features, A-B
- Ujjwal - texture features, C-D
- Anatoli - location features, TODO

(If you are not listed here, then contact me plz)

To achieve proposed goal, you should use statistical tests to show that the result of your investigation is not accidental, i.e. significant. But any additional materials as explanatory models and visualizations are welcome.
